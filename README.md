# deep-learning-module
Quick introduction to Deep Learning using TensorFlow and Python.

Disclaimers:
- Students of this content should have at least a beginner background in Machine Learning and Python.
- I have referenced my sources in two places: once in the notebook and once again in the PowerPoint.
- Approximately, 40% of the notebook is my code--with 98% of the text being my own (I have referenced where appropriate)--while 60% is code used from others.

Enjoy,
